**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**  

(If this is a *usage question*, please **do not post it here**—post it on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reduxable) instead. If this is not a “feature” or a “bug”, or the phrase “How do I...?” applies, then it's probably a usage question.)



**What is the current behavior?**



**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar.**



**What is the expected behavior?**



**Which versions of Reduxable, and which browser and OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of Reduxable?**
